# Greetings!

Welcome to the PicfPos repository.

Our goal is to develop a compact application that enables effortless indoor navigation using just a camera!

Feel encouraged to delve into our work. Alternatively, you can follow these steps to understand our successful approaches:
1. Implemented Computer Vision (CV) to identify different zones in an indoor environment.
2. Experimented with various models to assess their effectiveness in a room setting.
3. Hosted our model on a remote server, accessible here: [PicfPos Backend](https://github.com/Amnx404/picfpos-backend).
4. Developed a React-based front-end application that leverages our server for navigation purposes: [PicfPos App](https://github.com/Amnx404/picfpos-app).

Though the information might seem overwhelming at first, don't worry! We're preparing an in-depth Medium Article to explain everything in detail. Stay tuned!

Until then, farewell!
