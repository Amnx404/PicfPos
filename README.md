# Hey there!
Welcome to the repo of PicfPos

We are trying to build a small application/app which can help one navigate inside an indoor setting usin gjust their camera!

Fell free to explore our work, or follow the steps below to find out what worked for us:
1. We used CV to classify zones within an indoor setting
2. used various models to evaluate their performance inside a room
3. Deployed the model on a remote server : https://github.com/Amnx404/picfpos-backend
4. Created a react powered frontend to utilising the server in order to navigate : https://github.com/Amnx404/picfpos-app

I know its all jumbled up, but fear not, an indepth Medium Article coming soon!!!!
Until then bbyeee..
